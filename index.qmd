## Goals

and now I am pursuing my Masters in Wildlife Conservation and Biology at
the University of New Hampshire.

## Experience 

Before coming to grad school, I worked for the Seneca Nation
Environmental Protection Department as an Environmental Intern and then
as the Climate Change Program Manager!
